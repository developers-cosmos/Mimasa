# Mimasa - EmoteTrans [A Real-time Multilingual Face Translator]

The idea of the project is to create an application that can take a video input, detect the facial patterns
and speech of the person, translate the speech to another language and change the facial expression of the
person to match the output language. The final output is a video with the translated speech and modified
facial expression.

## Steps

The key steps required to implement this application would be:

1. Collecting a dataset of videos with labeled facial expressions and speech

2. Training models for facial expression recognition and speech-to-text

3. Integrating the trained models with the application

4. Using machine learning libraries for facial expression modification

5. Using machine learning libraries for language translation

6. Outputting the final video with modified facial expression

## Technologies

Here is a list of technologies that would be required to implement the application:

- **Facial Recognition:** OpenCV, dlib, MTCNN, etc.
Computer vision libraries such as OpenCV for processing and manipulating videos

- **Speech Recognition:** CMU Sphinx, Kaldi, Google Speech Recognition, etc.

- **Language Translation:** NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, Google Translate API, Microsoft Translator API, OpenNMT etc.
Natural Language Processing libraries such as NLTK or spaCy for language translation

- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, dlib, MTCNN, etc

- **Deep Learning:** Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.
Machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch for training and integrating models

- **Programming languages:** Python, C++, etc.

- **Development frameworks:** Flask, Django, etc.

- **Data storage:** SQL, MongoDB, etc.

## Steps & Examples

The following are the steps that would be required to implement this application:

1. **Video Input:** The first step would be to capture the video input. This could be done using a webcam or a video file.
    For example, you could use OpenCV library to read a video file using the following code:

    ```python
    import cv2
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture("example.mp4")
    ```

2. **Facial Recognition:** The next step would be to use facial recognition technology to detect the facial patterns of the
    person in the video. This could be done using deep learning-based algorithms such as OpenCV, dlib, and MTCNN. For example,
    you could use the MTCNN library to detect the faces in a video using the following code:

    ```python
    from mtcnn import MTCNN

    detector = MTCNN()

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        faces = detector.detect_faces(frame)

        for face in faces:
            x, y, width, height = face['box']
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x+width, y+height), (0, 0, 255), 2)
    ```

3. **Speech Recognition:** The application would need to recognize the speech of the person in the video.
    This could be done using speech recognition libraries such as CMU Sphinx, Kaldi, and Google Speech Recognition.
    For example, you could use the SpeechRecognition library to transcribe speech to text using the following code:

    ```python
    import speech_recognition as sr

    r = sr.Recognizer()

    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Say something!")
        audio = r.listen(source)

    text = r.recognize_google(audio)
    print(text)
    ```

4. **Language Translation:** The speech would then need to be translated to the desired output language.
    This could be done using natural language processing libraries such as NLTK, spaCy and Gensim or pre-trained
    models such as Google Translate API, Microsoft Translator API and OpenNMT. For example, you could use the
    googletrans library to translate a text to another language:

    ```python
    from googletrans import Translator

    translator = Translator()

    output_text = translator.translate(text, dest='hi').text
    ```

5. **Facial Expression modification:** Now the application should be able to change the facial expression
    of the person in the video to match the output language. This could be done using computer vision libraries
    such as OpenCV, dlib, and MTCNN. You could use OpenCV to change the facial expression of the person in the
    video. One popular method for this is using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new images
    with different facial expressions. Here is an example of how you could use the OpenCV library to manipulate
    the facial expressions in a video.

    ```python
    import cv2

    # Load the pre-trained GAN model
    model = load_model('model.h5')

    # Open the video file
    cap = cv2.VideoCapture('input.mp4')

    # Loop through each frame of the video
    while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break

    # Pre-process the frame
    frame = cv2.resize(frame, (64, 64))
    frame = frame.astype('float32') / 255.0

    # Generate new facial expression
    new_expression = model.predict(frame)

    # Post-process the new expression
    new_expression = new_expression * 255.0
    new_expression = new_expression.astype('uint8')
    new_expression = cv2.resize(new_expression, (640, 480))

    # Display the new expression
    cv2.imshow('New Expression', new_expression)
    cv2.waitKey(1)
    ```

    In this example, a pre-trained GAN model is loaded and used to generate new facial expressions for
    each frame of the video. The frame is pre-processed to resize it to the input size of the GAN model,
    and then the model is used to generate a new expression. The post-processing step is used to resize the
    generated expression back to the original size of the video frame.

6. **Output:** The final step would be to output the translated video with modified facial expression.
    This could be done using computer vision libraries such as OpenCV. For example, you could use the
    following code to write the modified video to a file:

    ```python
    fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'XVID')
    out = cv2.VideoWriter('output.avi', fourcc, 20.0, (640, 480))

    while True:
        ret, frame = cap.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        out.write(frame)

    out.release()
    ```

# Mimasa - EmoteTrans [A Real-time Multilingual Face Translator]

## Idea

The idea behind Mimasa is to provide a seamless translation experience for people who are communicating with individuals who speak different languages. The application uses advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and track the facial movements and speech of a person in real-time, and then uses natural language processing (NLP) to translate the speech to another language. The output audio is then synced with the facial movements of the person to provide a more natural and realistic translation experience. Additionally, Mimasa can also separate the music and speech from the video input, which allows for a more accurate translation experience. Overall, Mimasa aims to bridge the language barrier and make communication between people of different languages easier and more efficient.

## Steps

The general steps for implementing Mimasa:

1. Collect and preprocess the training data: This would involve obtaining a dataset of videos with speech in different languages, along with their corresponding translations. The data would then need to be preprocessed by extracting the audio and separating the speech from background noise and music.

2. Train a lip movement detection model: This would involve using computer vision techniques such as Viola-Jones or Haar cascades to train a model that can detect and track lip movements in the video.

3. Train a speech-to-text model: This would involve using machine learning techniques such as deep learning to train a model that can transcribe speech in different languages to text.

4. Train a machine translation model: This would involve using machine learning techniques such as neural machine translation to train a model that can translate text from one language to another.

5. Integrate the above models: Once the above models are trained, they would need to be integrated into the Mimasa application. This would involve using programming languages such as Python and libraries such as OpenCV, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

6. Develop the UI: The user interface would need to be developed so that the user can select the input and output languages, as well as control the playback of the video.

7. Test and evaluate the performance: The final system would need to be tested and evaluated on various test cases and the results should be analyzed.

## Tools & Technologies

Tools and technologies that would be required to implement Mimasa include:

1. Programming languages such as Python
2. Computer vision libraries such as OpenCV
3. Machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch
4. Speech processing libraries such as librosa
5. Natural Language Processing libraries such as NLTK
6. UI development frameworks such as PyQt
7. Cloud services such as AWS or Google Cloud for deployment

## Overview

Examples for steps in Mimasa can be found below,

1. **Video Input:** The first step is to capture the video input. This can be done using the OpenCV library in Python. The following example shows how to capture video from a webcam using OpenCV:

```python
import cv2

# create a VideoCapture object to access the webcam
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    # read the current frame from the webcam
    ret, frame = cap.read()

    # display the current frame
    cv2.imshow("Webcam", frame)

    # check if the user pressed the 'q' key
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

# release the resources
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

2.**Face Detection:** The next step is to detect faces in the video frames. This can be done using the Haar cascades provided by OpenCV, or using deep learning-based methods such as YOLO or RetinaFace. The following example shows how to use the Viola-Jones Haar cascades to detect faces in a frame:

```python
import cv2

# load the Haar cascade for face detection
face_cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier("path/to/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml")

# detect faces in the frame
gray = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))

# draw rectangles around the faces
for (x, y, w, h) in faces:
    cv2.rectangle(frame, (x, y), (x + w, y + h), (255, 0, 0), 2)
```

3.**Speech Separation:** The next step is to separate the speech from the audio. This can be done using audio processing libraries such as Librosa or pydub. The following example shows how to use Librosa to separate the speech from an audio file:

```python
import librosa

# load the audio file
y, sr = librosa.load("path/to/audio.wav")

# separate the speech from the background music using the SELD method
speech, _, _ = librosa.seld.seld(y, sr, hop_length=512)
```

4.**Speech Translation:** The next step is to translate the speech to another language. This can be done using machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow or PyTorch, or using online translation APIs such as Google Translate. The following example shows how to use Google Translate to translate a string of text from English to Spanish:

```python
from googletrans import Translator

# create a Translator object
translator = Translator()

# translate the text
text = "Hello world!"
translated_text = translator.translate(text, dest='es').text
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The other possible examples can be found below,

1. **Video Input:** Capture video input from the camera or a video file. This can be done using the OpenCV library in Python. Here is an example of how to capture video input from the camera:

```python
import cv2

# Start camera
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    cv2.imshow("Video", frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

2.**Face Detection:** Detect the faces in the video frame using a face detection algorithm. This can be done using the MTCNN or RetinaFace models. Here is an example of how to use the MTCNN model to detect faces in a frame:

```python
from mtcnn import MTCNN
import cv2

# Load MTCNN model
detector = MTCNN()

# Detect faces in frame
faces = detector.detect_faces(frame)
```

3.**Speech and Lip Movement Detection:** Detect the speech and lip movements of the person in the video. This can be done using the Google Speech Recognition library and OpenCV's Viola-Jones algorithm. Here is an example of how to use the Google Speech Recognition library to get the speech from the audio:

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

# Initialize recognizer class (for recognizing the speech)
r = sr.Recognizer()

# Reading Microphone as source
# listening the speech and store in audio_text variable
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    print("Talk")
    audio_text = r.listen(source)
    print("Time over, thanks")

# recoginize_() method will throw a request error if the API is unreachable
try:
    # using google speech recognition
    print("Text: "+r.recognize_google(audio_text))
except:
    pass
```

4.**Speech Translation:** Translate the speech to another language using a language translation API such as Google Translate or Microsoft Translate. Here is an example of how to use the Google Translate API to translate speech from English to Spanish:

```python
from googletrans import Translator

# Initialize translator
translator = Translator()

# Translate speech
translated_text = translator.translate(text, src='en', dest='es').text
```

5.**Sync Lip Movements:** Synchronize the lip movements of the person in the video to match the output audio. This can be done using OpenCV's facial landmark detection and image processing techniques. Here is an example of how to use OpenCV's facial landmark detection to get the coordinates of the lips:

```python
import dlib

# Initialize facial landmark detector
predictor = dlib.shape_predictor("shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat")

# Get coordinates of lips
points = predictor(gray, face_rect)
points = face_utils.shape_to_np(points)
```

6.Perform speech-to-text (STT) on the audio to convert it into text. You can use a library such as SpeechRecognition or Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for this step. Example:

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

r = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.AudioFile('audio.wav') as source:
    audio = r.record(source)

text = r.recognize_google(audio, language='en-US')
print(text)
```

7.Translate the text to the desired language using a library such as googletrans or Google Cloud Translation API. Example:

```python
from googletrans import Translator

translator = Translator()
translated_text = translator.translate(text, dest='fr').text
print(translated_text)
```

8.Perform text-to-speech (TTS) on the translated text to convert it back into speech. You can use a library such as gTTS or Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API for this step. Example:

```python
from gtts import gTTS

tts = gTTS(translated_text, lang='fr')
tts.save('translated_speech.mp3')
```

9.Synchronize the translated speech with the original lip movements and facial expressions by using a lip-sync algorithm. One example of a lip-sync algorithm is DeepFaceDrawing.

10.Finally, combine the translated speech and original music to create the final output video. You can use a library such as MoviePy for this step. Example:

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, concatenate_videoclips

original_video = VideoFileClip('original_video.mp4')
translated_speech = AudioFileClip('translated_speech.mp3')

final_video = original_video.set_audio(translated_speech)
final_video.write_videofile('final_output.mp4')
```

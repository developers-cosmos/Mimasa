# [Mimasa - EmoteTrans [A Real-time Multilingual Face Translator]](https://github.com/developers-cosmos/Mimasa) [![Build Python Package](https://github.com/developers-cosmos/Mimasa/actions/workflows/python-build.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/developers-cosmos/Mimasa/actions/workflows/python-build.yml) [![Release](https://github.com/developers-cosmos/Mimasa/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/developers-cosmos/Mimasa/actions/workflows/release.yml)

## Overview

The idea behind Mimasa is to provide a seamless translation experience for people who are communicating with individuals who speak different languages. The application uses advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and track the facial movements and speech of a person in real-time, and then uses natural language processing (NLP) to translate the speech to another language. The output audio is then synced with the facial movements of the person to provide a more natural and realistic translation experience. Additionally, Mimasa can also separate the music and speech from the video input, which allows for a more accurate translation experience. Overall, Mimasa aims to bridge the language barrier and make communication between people of different languages easier and more efficient.

## Django App Installation Guide for Mimasa

The Django app for Mimasa is a web-based application that allows users to interact with the Mimasa EmoteTrans Translation unit and perform real-time multilingual face translations. In this guide, we will walk through the steps required to install and run the Mimasa Django app on your local machine.

**NOTE:** Please note that the current implementation is only demo and not all components will work properly

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11.x
- pip
- Django 4.x
- Redis
- Celery

### Steps

After following the above steps to setup Mimasa locally, you will need to install the following:

1. Run the migrations

```shell
python src/api/mimasa/manage.py makemigrations
python src/api/mimasa/manage.py migrate
```

2. Run the Django server

```shell
python src/api/mimasa/manage.py runserver
```

3. Download the Redis ZIP archive from the official Redis website (<https://github.com/microsoftarchive/redis/releases>)

4. Extract the contents of the ZIP archive to a folder of your choice. Open the Command Prompt and navigate to the folder where you extracted Redis.
Run the following command to start Redis:

```shell
redis-server.exe redis.windows.conf
```

5. Open another Command Prompt window and navigate to the same folder. Run the following command to start the Redis CLI.

```shell
redis-cli.exe
```

6. Next step is to start celery worker to perform transaction tasks for Mimasa.
Run the following command to start a Celery worker:

```shell
cd src/api/mimasa
celery -A mimasa worker -l info -P eventlet
```

7. Congratulations! You have successfully completed the setup for Mimasa Django App, now you can perform translations at http:localhost:8000

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, please refer to the [issues](https://github.com/developers-cosmos/Mimasa/issues) section of the Mimasa repository. If your issue is not already reported, feel free to create a new issue with a detailed description of the problem.

## Demo

A demo of the Mimasa Django App (from Mimasa v1.1.0) can be seen from below link: [Mimasa -EmoteTrans Django App Demo Setup](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uG8pZMbJExo8oxWyOHEuLonoIt1pZ99S/view?usp=sharing). This demo version provides a limited functionality of the actual application, but should give you an idea of how the application works.

### Celery & Redis

- Celery is an asynchronous task queue/job queue based on distributed message passing. It is used to run background tasks in a concurrent fashion, allowing the application to continue processing other requests while a task is being executed.

- Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports a wide range of data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, and sets, making it a versatile and fast tool for storing and retrieving data.
